# Videre
**Videre** is a data visualization tool written in [julia](http://julialang.org) and currently under development. There already exists a more mature package called [GLPlot](https://github.com/SimonDanisch/GLPlot.jl) which has the capability of doing most of the plotting jobs. So I'm not attempted to make **Videre** another plotting tool, instead, I try to make it a good example for those who want to use/learn OpenGL with julia.

## Cumbersome-Simplified Style
I'm working on it now...
